# Bowling Alley REST API
My final project for cs493 cloud app development.

This is an API I designed to handle customers in a fictional bowling alley and is hosted on GoogleCloud and deployed on Google App Engine. By visiting the url the user will be asked to log in through google and oAuth2.0. If they are succesful their login token will posted onscreen and in the database.

The documentation listed under docs gives a complete description of the API. After logging in, a user can interact with the database by sending the requests to the defined endpoints. I used postman to send requests and an environment along with a series of tests are included in the docs folder.
